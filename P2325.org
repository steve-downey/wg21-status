#+begin_quote
Currently, the view concept is defined in 24.4.4 [range.view] as:
#+end_quote
#+begin_src
template <class T>
concept view =
    range<T> &&
    movable<T> &&
    default_initializable<T> &&
    enable_view<T>;
#+end_src
** Discussion
#+begin_quote
Three of these four criteria, I understand. A view clearly needs to be a range, and it’s important that they be movable for various operations to work. And the difference between a view and range is largely semantic, and so there needs to be an explicit opt-in in the form of enable_view.

But why does a view need to be default_initializable?
