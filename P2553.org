#+begin_quote
P0009 explicitly sets the size_type of extents to size_t, which is then used by layout mappings and mdspan. While this matches span whose extent function returns size_t, this behavior has significant performance impact on various architectures where 64-bit integer throughput is significantly lower than 32-bit integer computation throughput.

Proposal:

#+begin_quote
All in all we prefer the option of making extents require the additional argument (2.2.2), with the next best thing being the introduction basic_extents and making extents an alias to basic_extents with size_t as the size_type. If LEWG would prefer the second option, the wording is largely the same with the following changes at the end:

- Rename extents to basic_extents throughout P0009 and

- Add an alias in [mdspan.syn]:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src c++
template<size_t ... Extents>
using extents = basic_extents<size_t, Extents...>;
