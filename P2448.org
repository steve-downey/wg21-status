There are two rules about constexpr programming that make code ill-formed or ill-formed (no diagnostic required) when functions or function templates are marked constexpr that might never evaluate to a constant expression. But… so what if they don’t? The goal of this paper is to stop diagnosing problems that don’t exist.
