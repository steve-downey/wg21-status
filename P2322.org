While we do have an iterator-based version of fold in the standard library, it is currently named accumulate, defaults to performing + on its operands, and is found in the header <numeric>. But fold is much more than addition, so as described in the linked paper, itâ€™s important to give it the more generic name and to avoid a default operator.
