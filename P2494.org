Currently, many range adaptors require that the user-provided types they store must be copy constructible, which is also required by the assignment wrapper they use, copyable-box.

Similarly to how [P2325R3] turned semiregular-box into copyable-box, this paper proposes to turn copyable-box into movable-box. This name is probably not ideal, because it still turns types that happen to be copy constructible into copyable types, but it follows from the prior changes to the wrapper.
