This paper proposes adding many of the facilities in the ~[utilities]~, ~[ranges]~, and ~[iterators]~ clause to the freestanding subset of C++. The paper will be adding only complete entities, and will not tackle partial classes. For example, classes like ~pair~ and ~tuple~ are being added, but trickier classes like ~optional~, ~variant~, and ~bitset~ will come in another paper.

The ~<memory>~ header depends on facilities in ~<ranges>~ and ~<iterator>~, so those headers (and clauses) are addressed as well.
