We cannot currently fix the multidimensional c-array construction, since it is UB to alias a nested C-Array with a element type pointer - per discussion on the C++ committee reflector in January 2022. However, in practice it works (on the compilers we tested e.g. clang-based and gcc) - and it may be something the committee changes in the future - i.e. make it not-UB. We propotyped this capability, which requires an additional constructor from c-array and a few deduction guides.

What we can fix today is the deduction from 1D c-array, by adding a deduction guide from c-array constraint to rank-1 arrays.
