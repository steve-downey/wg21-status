#+begin_quote
~cbegin~ should always return a constant iterator.
#+end_quote

** Proposal
#+begin_quote
We can resolve this by extending ~std::ranges::cbegin~ and ~std::ranges::cend~
to conditionally wrap their provided rangeâ€™s iterator/sentinel pairs to ensure
that the result is a constant iterator, and use these tools to build up a
views::as_const range adapter. This completely solves the problem without any
imposed boilerplate per range.
