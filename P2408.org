#+begin_quote
Change the iterator requirements for non-Ranges algorithms. For forward iterators and above that are constant iterators, instead of requiring that iterators meet certain /Cpp17...Iterator/ requirements, require that the iterators model certain iterator concepts. This makes iterators from several standard views usable with non-Ranges algorithms that require forward iterators or above, such as the parallel overloads of most algorithms.
