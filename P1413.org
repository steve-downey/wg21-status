[] the standard library should provided two more symbols in the form of
typedefs that take in a single template type parameter and, on behalf of the
user, deduce the size and alignment of that type, passing in the values to
std::aligned_storage. The symbols should be ~std::aligned_storage_for~ and
~std::aligned_storage_for_t~. Like ~std::aligned_storage~ and
~std::aligned_storage_t~, they should be available in the ~<type_traits>~ header
of the standard library.
