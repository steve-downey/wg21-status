#+begin_quote
WG14 adopted a change for C2X that allows placement of labels everywhere inside a compound
statement (N2508). While this improves compatibility with C++ which previously diverged from C
by allowing labels in front of declarations, there is still a remaining incompatibility: C now does
allow labels at the end of a compound statement, while C++ does not. It is proposed to change the
C++ grammar to remove this remaining difference.

** Example
#+begin_src c++
void foo(void)
{
first: // allowed in C++, now also allowed in C
int x;
second: // allowed in both C++ and C
x = 1;
last: // not allowed in C++, but now allowed in C
}
