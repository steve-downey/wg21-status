#+begin_quote
~as_rvalue_view~ presents a view of an underlying sequence with the same behavior as the underlying sequence except that its elements are rvalues. Some generic algorithms can be called with a as_rvalue_view to replace copying with moving.

The name views::as_rvalue denotes a range adaptor object ([range.adaptor.object]).
