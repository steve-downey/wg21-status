#+begin_quote
Class template ~expected<T, E>~ is a vocabulary type which contains an expected value of type ~T~, or an error ~E~. The class skews towards behaving like a ~T~, because its intended use is when the expected type is contained. When something unexpected occurs, more typing is required. When all is good, code mostly looks as if a ~T~ were being handled.
