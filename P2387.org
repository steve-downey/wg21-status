Walter Brown made an excellent observation: if we gave users the tools to write their own range adaptors that would properly inter-operate with standard library adaptors (as well as other usersâ€™ adaptors), then it becomes less important to provide more adaptors in the standard library.

The goal of this paper is provide that functionality: provide a standard customization mechanism for range adaptors, so that everybody can write their own adaptors.
