Walter Brown made an excellent observation: if we gave users the tools to write their own range adaptors that would properly inter-operate with standard library adaptors (as well as other users’ adaptors), then it becomes less important to provide more adaptors in the standard library.

The goal of this paper is provide that functionality: provide a standard customization mechanism for range adaptors, so that everybody can write their own adaptors.
