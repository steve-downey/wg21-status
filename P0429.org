#+begin_quote
This paper outlines what a (mostly) API-compatible, non-node-based map might
look like. Rather than presenting a final design, this paper is intended as a
starting point for discussion and as a basis for future work. Specifically,
there is no mention of ~multimap~, ~set~, or ~multiset~.
#+end_quote

The final paper has wording for a map based on contiguous storage of keys and data.
