None of ~equality_comparable_with~, ~totally_ordered_with~, or
~three_way_comparable_with~ support move-only types. For move-only types, these
concept’s common reference requirement currently ends up requiring that the two
types ~const T&~ and ~const U&~ can be converted to the non-reference
~common_reference_t~, meaning that it requires ~T~ and ~U~ to be copyable. This
common reference requirement should be relaxed to support these move-only
types, effectively turning the common reference requirement into a common
_supertype_ requirement, as the original reason to require formable references
no longer exists.
