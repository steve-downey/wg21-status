#+begin_quote
This paper proposes a new standard library facility
~std::start_lifetime_as~. For objects of sufficiently trivial types, this
facility can be used to efficiently create objects and start their lifetime to
give programs defined behaviour, without running any constructor code. This
proposal completes the functionality proposed in [P0593R6] and adopted for
C++20 by providing the standard library portion of that paper (only the core
language portion of that paper made it into C++20).
