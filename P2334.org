This paper is being submitted as a liaison activity from WG14 C Language Working Group. The proposal
was discussed in the March 2021 meeting and approved (15 in favor, 1 opposed, 4 abstentions) for
inclusion into C23. This paper is being proposed to WG21 to avoid preprocessor incompatibilities with C
and because the utility is valuable to C++ users of the preprocessor.
