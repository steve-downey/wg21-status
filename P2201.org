#+begin_quote
String concatenation involving string-literals with encoding-prefixes mixing L"", u8"", u"", and U"" is currently conditionally-supported with implementation-defined behavior.
[...]
No meaningful use-case for such mixed concatenations is known.

This paper makes such mixed concatenations ill-formed.
