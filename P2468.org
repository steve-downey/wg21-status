This paper details some changes to make rewriting equality in expressions less of a breaking change

- If you want an operator== that is used for rewrites (automatically reversed, and != automatically generated), write only an operator==, and make sure its return type is bool.

- If you want an operator== that is not used for rewrites, write both an operator== and a matching operator!=.

- operator<=> is always used for rewrites (from <, <=, >, >=); if you don’t want rewrites, don’t write an operator<=>.
