This paper introduces the notion of _extended floating-point types_, modeled
after extended integer types. To accomodate them, this paper also attempts to
rewrite the current rules for floating-point types, to enable well-defined
interactions between all the floating-point types. The end goal of this paper,
together with [P1468], is to have a language to enable ~<cstdint>~-like aliases
for implementation specific floating point types, that can model more binary
layouts than just a single fundamental type (the previously proposed short
float) can provide for
