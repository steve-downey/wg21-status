This paper is about LWG 3714, Non-single-argument constructors for range adaptors should not be explicit.

We have C++20 views, none of which have explicit multi-param constructors, and some newer C++23 views which do. This is an obscure and rarely-noticeable difference. This paper looks at some aspects of it.
