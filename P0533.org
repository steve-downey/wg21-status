#+begin_quote
We propose simple criteria for selecting functions in <cmath> which should be
declared constexpr.  There is a small degree of overlap with <cstdlib>. The aim
is to transparently select a sufficiently large portion of <cmath> in order to
be useful but without placing too much burden on compiler vendors.

** Example
#+begin_src c++
constexpr int foo(float x) {
int a{}; int* pa{&a};
std::frexpr(x, pa);
return a;
}

constexpr int i{foo(0.5f)}.
