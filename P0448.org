#+begin_quote
This paper proposes a class template ~basic_spanbuf~ and the corresponding stream
class templates to enable the use of streams on externally provided memory
buffers. No ownership or re-allocation support is given. For those features we
have string-based streams

**** Example
#+begin_src c++
char        input[] = "10 20 30";
ispanstream is{span<char>{input}};
int         i;
is >> i;
ASSERT_EQUAL(10, i);
is >> i;
ASSERT_EQUAL(20, i);
is >> i;
ASSERT_EQUAL(30, i);
is >> i;
ASSERT(!is);
#+end_src
