#+begin_quote
This proposal seeks to add std::ranges::starts_with and std::ranges::ends_with, which would work on arbitrary ranges, and also answer questions such as "are the starting elements of `r1` less than the elements of `r2`?" and "are the final elements of `r1` greater than the elements of `r2`?"

** Before/After Table
Before:
#+begin_src c++
auto some_ints      = view::iota(0, 50);
auto some_more_ints = view::iota(0, 30);
if (ranges::mismatch(some_ints, some_more_ints).in2 == end(some_more_ints)) {
    // do something
}
#+end_src
After:
#+begin_src c++
auto some_ints      = view::iota(0, 50);
auto some_more_ints = view::iota(0, 30);
if (ranges::starts_with(some_ints, some_more_ints)) {
    // do something
}
#+end_src
