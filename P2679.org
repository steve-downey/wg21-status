#+begin_quote
std::start_lifetime_as and std::start_lifetime_as_array, facilities to
explicitly start the lifetime of an object of implicit-lifetime type inside a
block of suitably aligned storage, was introduced in [P2590R2] and voted into
C++23. We propose to fix some remaining issues before C++23 ships. We also
discuss possible changes to the API that were considered but rejected.
