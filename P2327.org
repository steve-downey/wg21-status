The C++ 20 standard deprecated many functionalities of the volatile keyword. This was due to
P1152[Bastien, 2019]. The reasoning is given in the R0 version of the paper[Bastien, 2018].

The deprecation was not received too well in the embedded community as volatile is commonly
used for communicating with peripheral devices in microcontrollers[van Ooijen, 2020].

The purpose of this paper is to give a solution that will not undo what was achieved with
P1152, and still keep the parts that are critical to the embedded community.
