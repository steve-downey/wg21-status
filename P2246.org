#+begin_quote
The standard provides a few mechanisms that suggest an implementation issues a diagnostic based on
text written in the source code. However, the standard does not uniformly address what should happen
if the execution character set of the compiler cannot represent the text in the source character set.

#+begin_quote
Because the display of diagnostic messages should be merely a matter of Quality of Implementation, the
proposal is to place no character set related requirements on the diagnostic output with the
understanding that implementations will do what makes the most sense for their situation when issuing
diagnostics in terms of which characters need to be escaped or otherwise handled in a special way.
