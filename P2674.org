#+begin_quote
C++20 introduced the notion of implicit-lifetime types. There are certain
operations that are only valid for such types. We therefore need a way to check
whether a type is implicit-lifetime, and constrain on this property. This paper
proposes a new type trait std::is_implicit_lifetime to achieve this.
