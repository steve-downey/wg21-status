Given the following declarations:

#+begin_src c++
struct A {
    friend auto begin(A const&) -> int const*;
    friend auto end(A const&)   -> int const*;
};

struct B {
    friend auto begin(B&) -> int*;
    friend auto end(B&) -> int*;
};
#+end_src

B and const A satisfy std::ranges::range, but A does not. The goal of this paper is that both of these should count as ranges.
