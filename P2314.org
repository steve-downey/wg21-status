This paper implements the following changes:
- Switch C++ to a modified "model C" approach for universal-character-names as described in the C99 Rationale v5.10, section 5.2.1.
- Introduce the term "literal encoding". For purposes of the C++ specification, the actual set of characters is not relevant, but the sequence of code units (i.e. the encoding) specified by a given character or string literal are. The terms "execution (wide) character set" are retained to describe the locale-dependent runtime character set used by functions such as isalpha.
- (Not a wording change) Do not attempt to treat all string literals the same; their treatment depends on (phase 7) context.

** Before/After Table
Before:
#+begin_src c++
#define S(x) # x
const char * s1 = S(Köppe);       // "K\\u00f6ppe"
const char * s2 = S(K\u00f6ppe);  // "K\\u00f6ppe"
#+end_src
After:
#+begin_src c++
#define S(x) # x
const char * s1 = S(Köppe);       // "Köppe"
const char * s2 = S(K\u00f6ppe);  // "Köppe"
