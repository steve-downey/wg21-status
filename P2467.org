Historically, C++ iostreams libraries had a ~noreplace~ open mode that corresponded to the ~O_EXCL~ flag for POSIX ~open~. That mode was not included in the C++98 standard, presumably for portability reasons, because it wasn't in ISO C90.

Since then, ISO C added support for "exclusive" mode to ~fopen~, so now C++'s ~<fstream>~ is missing a feature that is present in both ISO C and POSIX. We should fix this for C++23.
