The ~current_exception~ wording was carefully written to allow both ABIs like
MSVC++â€™s where the exception objects are generally constructed on the stack,
and ABIs like the Itanium C++ ABI where the exception objects are generally
constructed on the heap (and possibly reference counted).  Implementations are
given the freedom they need to (possibly) copy the exception object into the
memory held by the exception_ptr, and similar. See
http://eel.is/c++draft/propagation#8.

Unfortunately, such care was not taken for ~rethrow_exception~.
