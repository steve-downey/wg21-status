Unintended consequences of ~std::barrier~ â€™s specification constrain implementations to run the ~CompletionFunction~ on the last thread that arrives at the barrier during the phase. This prevents ~std::barrier~ from benefiting from hardware acceleration for thread synchronization. Removing these constraints is a _breaking change_. This paper aims to find a sweet spot for the barrier specification that delivers the functionality that applications need while allowing efficient implementations.
