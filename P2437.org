#+begin_quote
Almost all major C++ compilers support the #warning preprocessing directive to
generate a diagnostic message from the preprocessor without stopping
translation, as ~#error~ does, which can be useful for code authors who want to
warn consumers of the code about non-fatal concerns.

WG14 considered a similar proposal as part of WG14 N2686 at our Sept 2021
meeting and adopted the feature into C23 (straw poll results were: 17 in favor,
0 oppose, 1 abstain). The WG21 proposal is functionally identical to the WG14
proposal, with the only difference being due to existing variance in
specification around how ~#error~ causes translation to stop.
