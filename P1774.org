We propose a standard facility providing the semantics of existing compiler intrinsics such as
~__builtin_assume~ (Clang) and ~__assume~ (MSVC, Intel) that tell the compiler to assume a
given C++ expression without evaluating it, and to optimise based on this assumption. This is
very useful for high-performance and low-latency applications in order to generate both faster
and smaller code.
