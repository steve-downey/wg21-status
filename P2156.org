The standard attributes noreturn, carries dependency, and deprecated all
specify that they cannot appear more than once in an attribute-list, but there
is no such prohibition if they appear in separate attribute-specifiers within a
single attributespecifier-seq. Since intuitively these cases are equivalent,
they should be treated the same, accepting duplicates in both or neither.
