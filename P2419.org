#+begin_quote
C++20 added formatting of chrono types with std::format but left unspecified what happens during localized formatting when the locale and literal encodings do not match ([LWG3565]).
#+end_quote

** Proposal
#+begin_quote
We propose clarifying the specification to prevent mojibake when possible by allowing implementation do transcoding or substituting the locale so that the result is in a consistent encoding.
