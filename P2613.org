This paper propose to fix a defect in [P0009R17]. During its LWG review, I found that even though the proposed std::mdspan type have a size() member function, it does not have an empty() member function, which makes it distinct from nearly all other STL containers. So this paper propose to add the missing member to increase consistency and performance of common operations.
